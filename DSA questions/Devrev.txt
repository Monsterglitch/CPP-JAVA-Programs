1) (LeetCode) Max area in Histogram.

3) In the enchanted forest, Alex has discovered a magical tree with n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. This tree is a connected, acyclic graph with n-1 branches. Each node has a maximum of 3 connections, except the root (node 1), which has up to 2 connections.

Unfortunately, the root node is cursed.

Over n phases, Alex can:

1. Choose a non-cursed and non-removed node and remove it along with its connections, or

2. Do nothing.

After each phase, the curse spreads to all nodes directly connected to already cursed nodes. Alex's goal is to maximize the number of nodes that remain uncursed (removed nodes are not counted as saved).

Help Alex determine the maximum number of nodes he can save from the curse.

Examples:

Input:
4

1 2

2 3

2 4

Output:

2

Explanation:

If we delete vertex 2 we can save vertices 3 and 4.
Input/Output

• [execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)

• [memory limit] 1 GB

• [input] integer n

Number of vertices in the tree.

Guaranteed constraints: 2 ≤ n ≤ 3*105

• [input] array.array.integer edgeList

Each sub-list represents an edge and contains exactly two integers. The integers represent the vertices connected by the edge. For e.g: edgeList[i] represent the undirected edge between edgeList[i][0] and edgeList[i][1]

Guaranteed constraints: 1 s edgeList[i][0], edgeList[i][1] ≤ n

• [output] integer

Output the maximum number of vertices Alex can save.

4) In preparation for a sports tournament, you have n training exercises available. Completing the i-th exercise improves your skills by arr[i] points. You can only perform one exercise per day, and once you complete an exercise, you must wait k days before repeating it. For example, if k=2 and you perform exercise 1 on day 1, you cannot repeat it on days 2 and 3, but can do it again on day 4.

Given two targets: achieve at least c skill points within d days. Determine the maximum k that allows you to meet this goal. If no such k exists or k is arbitrarily large, output -1.

Examples:

Input:

2 5 4

1 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

In the given example, one way to gain 5 skill point over 4 days with K=2 is as follows:
Day 1: do exercise 2, and gain 2 skill points.

Day 2: do exercise 1, and gain 1 skill points.

Day 3: do nothing.

Day 4: do exercise 2, and gain 2 skill points.

In total, we gained 2+1+2=5 skill points.
